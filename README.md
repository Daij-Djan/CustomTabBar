<br/>

This project implements a custom UITabBar with a raised center button. It is based on the blog post [Recreating The Raised Center Tab Bar Button of Instagram, DailyBooth & Pathâ„¢](http://idevrecipes.com/2010/12/16/raised-center-tab-bar-button/).
<br/>
<br/>
Main differences:

-   use of Storyboard
-   the center button switches to its related UIViewController
